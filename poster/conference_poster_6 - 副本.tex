%\section*{Abstract}
%\normalsize The emerging sharing economy has disrupted the housing and transportation sectors. The underlining business model exploits underutilized infrastructure through sharing. In this paper, we explore sharing economy opportunities in electricity sector. There are considerable obstacles to sharing electricity. First,  the flow of electricity is governed by Kirchoff's Laws and we cannot prescribe a point to point path for its flow. Second, regulatory and policy obstacles may impede sharing opportunities. As a result, early adopters will be in the context of behind-the-meter sharing opportunities. In this paper, we study one of these opportunities. Specifically, we consider a collection of firms that invest in storage to arbitrage against the time of use pricing they face. We show that the investment decision of the firms form a Nash equilibrium which supports the social welfare. We offer explicit expressions for optimal storage investments and equilibrium prices for shared storage in a spot market. Finally, we use field data to assess the performance of our proposed sharing scheme.

Optimal storage investment is {\sl extensive}, i.e. increases as new firms join
\[ C^{n+1} \geq C^n \]

\begin{itemize}
\item \blue{Who benefits?}
\bdashlist
\item  $F_{n+1}$ is better off by joining 
\item collective is bettor off when $F_{n+1}$ joins 
\item \red{but do firms in the collective individually benefit? don't know}

\section*{Joining the Club}

\begin{itemize}
\item \blue{Optimal ownership redistributes when $F_{n+1}$ joins}
\[ C^n = (\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n) \ \ \rightarrow \ \ C^{n+1} = (\beta_1,  \cdots, \beta_n, \beta_{n+1}) \] 
\item \blue{Actions}
\bdashlist
%\item buys $\beta_{n+1}$ units of storage, owns revenue stream
\item new firm $F_{n+1}$ pays the collective $\pi_s \beta_{n+1}$
\item receives rights and revenue stream for $\beta_{n+1}$ units of storage
\item collective invests in $C^{n+1} - C^{n}$ additional storage 
\item internal exchange of money and storage ownership within collective
\end{list}

\section*{Market Implementation}

\noindent \textbf{Theorem}
No pure storage play:
\[ X_k \equiv 0 \ \implies C_k^\ast = 0 \]
Therefore AGG is in a neutral financial position



\begin{itemize}
\item \blue{Privacy and market clearing}
\bdashlist
\item to determine its investment $C_k^\ast$, firm $k$ need knowledge of collective investment and statistics
\item informed by neutral AGG
\item AGG determines clearing price $\pi_{eq}$ each day
\end{list}

\item \blue{Other market choices?}
\bdashlist
\item bulletin board for P2P bilateral trades
\item matching market hosted by AGG
\end{list}
\end{itemize}
